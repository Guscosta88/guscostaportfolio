            <p> The Italian Bar is a family run business established in 2004 offering a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere that is simultaneously stylish and traditional.

Specialising in good old-fashioned pizzas and pastas, not mentioning it being great value for money. We pride ourselves on the simplicity of our menu and maintain its high quality ingredients. Our Pizzeria has built its reputation on "food, service and family", no wonder it has become one of the most popular family pizza spots.</p>
